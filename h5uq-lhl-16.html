___ What is this? ___ The idea behind the monthly community map is to share a map exchange string at the beginning of every month, and get as many people as we can to start a new world with it. Then at the end of the month (or even periodically if you'd prefer!) we share screenshots and saves of our factories so that we can see how different people approach the same spawn; how they set up their base, how they deal with aliens, and how they arrange their science, power, and everything else. 7.12.17 –ó–¥—Ä–∞–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–π—Ç–µ, —Ö–æ—á—É –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç—å —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∏–µ –≤ –≤–∞—à–µ–º —Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∏—Ä–µ, –≤ —Ö–æ–∫–∫–µ–π –∏–≥—Ä–∞–ª —Å 7 –¥–æ 16 –ª–µ—Ç, –æ–ø—ã—Ç –µ—Å—Ç—å. –î–∞—Ç–∞ —Ä–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è: 07.09.1999 –ü—Ä–æ–∂–∏–≤–∞—é. # Preface Please criticize my reviews!

However, I leave everything in when looking at career records as the length of the season is irrelevant in that situation. The data is based on starters with a reasonable number of games played (~10 or more in any one season or ~30 or more career) to work from.

For many players, the Shugoki has the following weaknesses: He is slow both in terms of movement and attacking. He‚Äôs easily parried at higher levels and has the worst dodge in the game. He lacks a viable opener, especially at higher levels. Limited moveset. This makes him predictable. Losing Hyper Armour increases the damage he takes. Some of the Shugoki‚Äôs moves are not very viable. The Demon‚Äôs Embrace from neutral and the Heavy Attack Cancel are both very slow making them telegraphed. ##New Players New players looking for more information can look here (/8xj4lv/).
